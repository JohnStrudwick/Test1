Initial Test Repo

Hi Humans

I am an experienced Technical Director, CTO, Development Manager, Technical Architect & Project Director. I have run teams large and small and delivered many projects. I am currently specialising in mobile telecoms. Technologies include ASP.Net, C#, C++, C, SQL, Agile, OOD, SS7, Linux, MAP etc.

I have developed and delivered many software, business & mobile telecom systems. I have run my own companies and the technical side for a number of others. I understand business and software systems at all levels, and know how to manage project finances.

I have an extraordinary broad range of experience that includes some years in the music business, being fortunate to work with some of the most famous people on the planet; then moving on to design, sell, build and deliver systems across a range of industries e.g. Recording studio consoles & computer systems, digital audio, escape system for London Underground, conference & voting systems, document management, NHS systems, digital dictation, purchase ordering & financial integrations and over recent years mobile telecoms.

I am capable of interacting at the highest level, and have the ability to see the big picture and architect technical implementations. These days I design the boxes and my teams make the those work using appropriate technologies. As well as dotNet, I am now also familiar with Git, Ruby on Rails, Python, Node.js, backbone.js, coffeeScript etc. & have used AWS.

I am known for delivering systems on time and that that actually work. I have been selected in the past mainly through recommendations or repeat business.
